This dataset includes an HTML file with scripts and details that sustain the finding of this study. The scripts are organized following the article structure:
1. Variant calling and filtering: This section describes how the variant calling was done and the details of the filtering steps.
2. Pattern of population genetic diversity and differentiation: This section gives details and code about how the genetic diversity estimates and AMOVA were calculated.
3. Spatial genetic structure: Here, we give the details for ADMIXTURE, PCA, UMAP, EEMS, un-PC, and phylogenetic analyses.
4. Influence of environmental variation on spatial genetic variation: We give code details about the partial RDA analysis.


We also added the final trimmed Achnatherum thurberianum vcf file. Details on the variant calling and filtering can be found in the first section of the HTML file.
